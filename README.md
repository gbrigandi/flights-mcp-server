## ‚ö° Quick Start


### Claude Desktop

1. Make sure you have the latest [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) downloaded!

2. Clone This Repo

3. Install `uv` to set up our Python Environment

   #### MacOS

   ```bash
   # Check if uv is already installed
   uv --version

   # If not installed
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

   #### Windows

   ```powershell
   # Check if uv is already installed
   uv --version

   # If not installed
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

   Restart your terminal for the `uv` command to get picked up

4. Add this flights MCP Server to your Claude for Desktop config:

   #### MacOS

   - Config file location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Create/edit using:

   ```bash
   code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   #### Windows

   - Config file location: `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Create/edit using:

   ```powershell
   code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   Note: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json` is a different, unrelated file. Do not edit it.

5. Add this flights MCP Server in the `mcpServers` key:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "flights": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/flights",
           "run",
           "flights.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Make sure to modify the code to include the Absolute Path to this Repo.

6. That's it! Open Claude for Desktop and you should see the little MCP Tools icon appear (make sure to re-open the app for updates to take place‚Äîyou'll need to do this whenever you change your `claude_desktop_config.json` file üòä)

Note: If you get an Error, try adding the absolute path for `uv`. Refer to the UV Set Up Issue Section below.

### Cursor

1. Open Cursor & Go to Settings

2. Press the MCP Tab on the Left Panel

3. Add a new MCP Server (Choose one):

   #### Project Configuration

   - Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory
   - Ideal for tools specific to a single project

   #### Global Configuration

   - Create a `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory
   - Makes MCP servers available across all Cursor workspaces

4. Attach the following configuration in the `mcp.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "flights": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/flights",
           "run",
           "flights.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Make sure to replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/flights` with the actual path to this repo.

   Example: `/Users/sahitmamidipaka/Documents/Google-Flights-MCP-Server`

Note: If you get an Error, try adding the absolute path for `uv`. Refer to the UV Set Up Issue Section below.

For more information, refer to the [Official Cursor MCP Documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).

### UV Set Up Issue

You may need to put the full path to the `uv` executable in the command field. You can get this by running:
- `which uv` on MacOS/Linux
- `where uv` on Windows
